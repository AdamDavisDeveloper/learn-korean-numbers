# Sino-Korean Number Generator with Flash Cards

Learning the sino-korean number system is not easy. The rules are simple, but practicing them can be rather impractical. Sure, you could have numbers generated for you and you could translate them yourself for practice, but doing the reverse would take *forever* to write out and shuffle 9999 flashcards. That's why I created this algorithm and website to give you access to all of those cards on-the-go so you can translate them from Korean to digits in your head, then flip the card to see if you got it right! <br>
There will eventually be settings to make this more customized.
(The "About" and "Settings" sections still need to be finished) :)
